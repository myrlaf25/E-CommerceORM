## Description


This app was built with internet retail in mind. E-commerce, is the largest sector of the electronics industry. This is a backend application. Starter code was provided by Trilogy. 
As mentioned before, starter code was provided for this project. I completed building all the necessary models and routes. The necessary packages were downloaded in order for this app to function. This backend app uses Express.js API, Sequelize, and MySQL Database. The database name was added to the .env file, along with a username and I did not submit a password for thsi particular project but the user may enter a password. The database contains information of categories, products, product tags, and tags.

## Installation

The user will have to install Express.js, Sequelize, and MySQL 2. 


## Usage

I am able to connect to the database using Sequelize. I used commands in MySql terminal to create the database. The schema and seeds were available through the files and was uploaded with the command node seeds/index.js in the git bash terminal. The user is able to verify is the information was created in MySQL terminal. The user will then be able to enter the command in git bash terminal to invoke the application. The server is started and the Sequelize models are synced to the MySQL database.

## Tests
Once the user enters the command, nodemon server.js to invoke the application, the user may utilize Insomnia Core to check the functionality. The API routes: GET will display all information in the tables by categories, products, and tags. The data will be displayed in a formatted JSON. The user may also test API for POST, PUT, and DELETE routes. THis shows the user the app is able to successfully CREATE, UPDATE, and DELETE data from the database.
